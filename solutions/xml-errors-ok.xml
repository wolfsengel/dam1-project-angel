			Based upon the friendship and eventual breakdown between <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> in the very early startup days of Microsoft and Apple from their home garages. This film does a great job of showing it&#x27;s about being the first to have an idea, it&#x27;s about who&#x27;s first to act on it properly and with passion, exemplified by their "theft" of the first GUI system from Xerox.
